# Intervention Manager (IM)

The *im* component allows users to easily define intervention rules to orchestrate a production system. The component monitors the status of the worker-factory ecosystem in real-time, by elaborating data from sensors, machines, workers monitoring systems, ERP, and more. The set of intervention rules are known to the *im*, which decides which is the best one to trigger.
