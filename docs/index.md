# Intervention Manager (IM)

The IM component allows users to easily define intervention rules to
orchestrate a production system. The component monitors the status of the
worker-factory ecosystem in real-time, by elaborating data from sensors,
machines, workers monitoring systems, ERP, and more. The set of intervention
rules are known to the IM, which decides which is the best one to trigger.
