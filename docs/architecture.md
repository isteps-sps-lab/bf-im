# Architecture

Within the Better Factory project, the IM is deployed as part of the Cognitive Human Robot Interaction (C-HRI) scenario.
The deployment is based on Docker Compose, and the set of initialized components is depicted in the picture here below:

``` mermaid

    classDef supsi fill:#B4C7DC,color:#000;
    classDef pvt fill:#B2B2B2,color:#000;
    classDef pub fill:#E8F2A1,color:#000;

    subgraph SUPSI
    direction TB
    im:::supsi <--> middleware:::supsi
    kafka-message-model:::supsi --> middleware:::supsi
    end

    subgraph Private Deps
    models:::pvt <--> im:::supsi
    end

    subgraph Public Deps
    models:::pvt <--> models-db:::pub
    end

```

The blue-colored components represent the core components for which SUPSI provides and maintains a Docker image; the other components represent Docker images that are either publicly available (green-colored) or maintened by other Better Factory partners (grey-colored).

!!! info

    In this deployment version, all the Docker images but the public ones can be downloaded from the [RAMP Docker Registry](https://docker.ramp.eu/).

## Dependencies

### middleware

The image is based on the [fast-data-dev (v2.6.2)](https://github.com/lensesio/fast-data-dev/tree/fdd/2.6.2) project by Lenses.io and runs a full fledged Kafka installation (including extra services, e.g., UIs).

In addition, the Schema Registry is automatically populated with schemas available under the `/schemas` directory. In our deployment, the `/schemas` directory is read from the *kafka-message-model* component.

The middleware is run in secure mode and can be accessed at [localhost:3040](localhost:3040) (credentials are stored in the docker-compose file).

### kafka-message-model
This component embeds the data model shared within the Better Factory project. The data model is automatically uploaded to the Schema Registry available within the *middleware*.

### models
The *models* component exposes a REST API to access the data model shared among all the components involved in the C-HRI scenario. The API is accessed by the IM to fetch information about workers and other factory elements.

### models-db
The *models-db* component runs an official MySql docker image (v5.7).
