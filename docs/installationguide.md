# Installation Guide

## Requirements

All the components are provided as Dockerized applications, thus the following software is required:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

!!! info
    We tested our deployment on a machine running Ubuntu 21, with Docker v20.10.8, and Docker Compose v1.29.2.

## Install

Before running the containers, it is required to download the Docker images from their respective registries.
While some images are publicly available, some other require credentials to be downloaded from private registries.

!!! faq
    Images provided by SUPSI can be download from the GitLab container registry, which supports the token-based authentication. Please send your request for a new token to the repository maintainers.

Once you are provided with a username and a token, you can issue the following command to login to the private GitLab Docker registry and download the images:

```shell
docker login registry.example.com -u <username> -p <token>
docker-compose pull
```

## Usage
The docker-compose file automatically runs all the components as Docker containers. Each container can be customized by editing its environment parameters. The current deployment already set the right values for all the parameters.
We suggest the user to only modify variables listed in the `.env` file, if needed.

| Parameter name             | Parameter value | Default |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------  |
| BF_USER | A username shared by all the components | **bfuser** |
| BF_PASSWORD | A password shared by all the components | **bfpwd123** |
| MODELS_MYSQL_DATABASE | Name of the database to store the shared model | **models**|
| MODELS_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD | Password for the root user in MySQL | **root** |

Run the **up** command to start all the containers:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now access different components:

- The IM is available at [localhost:8666](http://localhost:8666); you can use the IM UI to edit the possible interventions available for the factory. The intervention will be triggered by the IM and written to the *middleware* component.

- Kafka is accessible from the Kafka Development Environment, which is available at [localhost:3040](http://localhost:3040/). Here you can check schemas uploaded to the Schema Registry, as well as existing Kafka topics and their content.
